## Running tests

### With kubevirtci
Tests can be run against kubevirtci-based local k8s cluster. To run them, execute
```bash
automation/test.sh
```

### With external k8s cluster
Test suite can be run against existing, external k8s cluster. To do it, execute:
```bash
KUBECTL=<kubectl command> IMAGEIO_NAMESPACE=<imageio installation namespace> KUBEVIRT_NAMESPACE=<namespace where kubevirt has been installed> KUBECONFIG=<path to the kubeconfig> automation/execute-tests.sh
```

for example:

```bash
KUBECTL=kubectl IMAGEIO_NAMESPACE=kubevirt-hyperconverged KUBEVIRT_NAMESPACE=kubevirt-hyperconverged KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config automation/execute-tests.sh
```

Additional options variables that can be provided:
 - DEFAULT_SC - name of the cluster's default storage class
 - NFS_SC - name of an NFS-backed storage class
